            <p>Mapping is a relationship between the elements of two sets of things. Here are some examples:</p>
            <img class="medium-img" src="../img/myproject/03-understanding-mapping/mapping-switch-01.JPG" alt="a lamp and a switch in a room">
            <p>We have a conceptual model: for turning on the light in the room, there should be a switch somewhere in the same room. But since there is only one light and one switch in this room, it's pretty obvious this only switch is for turning on the only light in the room. Moreover, the switch is not hard to find and is placed as near as possible to the light.</p>

            <img class="medium-img" src="../img/myproject/03-understanding-mapping/mapping-stove-03.png" alt="trevor bingley (rowan atkinson) from man vs bee tv series trying to cook">
            <p>The man in these pictures is Trevor Bingley (played by Rowan Atkinson) from the TV series Man Vs Bee. Trevor is a house-sitter who was hired by a rich couple to house-sit their house while they are away. As a stranger in the house, Trevor was not familiar with the house, because obviously the house is not his.</p>
            <p>In one of the scenes in episode 1, Trevor heads to the kitchen and try to cook some meal. Here's where mapping fails:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Frame 1 - Trevor prepares to cook the meal. From the frame, we can see the layout of the knobs of the stove, it is vertical.</li>
                <li>Frame 2 - Trevor pours the meal into the pot. From the frame, we can see the layout of the stove is rectangle, not vertical like the knob's layout.</li>
                <li>Frame 3 - Trevor finds himself confused.</li>
                <li>Frame 4 - Trevor chooses the second knob from the bottom.</li>
                <li>Frame 5 and Frame 6 - It turns out the knob Trevor was turning was wrong.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Trevor knows how stove in general works. He has the conceptual model of how stove works: stoves have as many knobs as the burner. If there are 4 burners, there must be 4 knobs to turn them on, 5 burners - 5 knobs.</p>
            <img class="medium-img" src="../img/myproject/03-understanding-mapping/mapping-stove-04.JPG" alt="wrong stove assumption">
            <p>Trevor's initial assumption was the relationship between the knobs and the burners is like the picture above. That was why he tried to turn knob B to activate burner “B”.</p>
            <img class="medium-img" src="../img/myproject/03-understanding-mapping/mapping-stove-05.JPG" alt="(probably) correct stove assumption">
            <p>But he was wrong, because the burner “B” that he initially thought was actually burner D. And he had to turn the second knob from the top instead.</p>
            
            <p>What can we fix from the design? Here are some examples of the knobs layout so that the stove can be used more intuitively with no confusion.</p>
            <img class="medium-img" src="../img/myproject/03-understanding-mapping/mapping-stove-09.JPG" alt="three layouts of what might be better design for the knobs">
            <ul>
                <li>The first layout has a design to mirror exactly how the burners was designed. This is the most intuitive layout design. But from the visual design standpoint, this layout can be considered not pretty.</li>
                <li>The second layout has the same concept as the first layout but with less “spread” space. We can still tell intuitively which knob activate which burner.</li>
                <li>The third layout is not as intuitive as the first two layouts, but it's certainly more intuitive than the original because there's some spaces to separate the top burners, the middle burner, and the bottom burners. From the visual standpoint, this layout is prettier than the first two.</li>
            </ul>
