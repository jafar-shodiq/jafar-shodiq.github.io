            <p>Affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.
                It is about <strong>what are the possible actions that we can apply to this object?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Here are some examples:</p>
            <img class="medium-img" src="../img/myproject/01-understanding-affordances/affordance-chair-01.jpg" alt="a black chair pov up">
            <img class="medium-img" src="../img/myproject/01-understanding-affordances/affordance-chair-02.jpg" alt="a black chair pov down showing wheels and a handle">
            <ul>
                <li>This chair has surfaces that can support our lower body and our back. Therefore, this chair affords sitting and leaning back.</li>
                <li>This chair has two horizonal plate-like surfaces with comfortable height on each side of the chair and shoulder length width. Therefore, this chair affords resting our arms.</li>
                <li>These armrests also have room for grabbing. Therefore, this chair affords grabbing, lifting or pulling.</li>
                <li>This chair has five wheels at the bottom that can rotate 360 degrees. Therefore, this chair affords moving in every direction.</li>
                <li>This chair has a handle that can be reached while sitting down. Therefore, this handle affords grabbing. Which results in the chair going up (higher) or down (lower).</li>
            </ul>

            <img class="medium-img" src="../img/myproject/01-understanding-affordances/affordance-guitar-01.jpg" alt="a brown guitar placed standing lean on a wall">
            <img class="medium-img" src="../img/myproject/01-understanding-affordances/affordance-guitar-02.jpg" alt="features on the guitar">
            <ul>
                <li>This guitar has strings. Therefore, this guitar affords plucking or strumming.</li>
                <li>This guitar has fret boards. Therefore, this guitar affords tapping or holding down with our fingers.</li>
                <li>This guitar has finger-size pegs that are loose. Therefore, these guitar pegs afford rotating.</li>
                <li>This guitar has a long part that can be used for grabbing. Therefore, this guitar affords grabbing and lifting.</li>
                <li>This guitar has a curved design on both sides of the main body. Therefore, this guitar affords support while the player is sitting down. These two sides curves afford support for both right-handed and left-handed player.</li>
                <li>This guitar has several additional features on one of the sides. These features include spinning buttons, a slider, and a regular button. Therefore, these features afford spinning/turning/rotating, sliding, and clicking/pushing.</li>
            </ul>

            <img class="medium-img" src="../img/myproject/01-understanding-affordances/affordance-youtube-01.png" alt="a youtube page">
            <p>Let's remind ourselves: affordance is a relationship between the properties of an object and the capabilities of the agent that determine just how the object could possibly be used.
                Therefore, what possible actions from YouTube are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>YouTube has their logo on every page. Therefore, YouTube affords to be recognized by users/visitors that they are still on 'YouTube' site.</li>
                <li>YouTube has a big display screen dedicated for showing videos we want to watch. Therefore, YouTube affords displaying video for the user.</li>
                <li>YouTube has a section where they show us videos we might be interested in. Therefore, YouTube affords displaying related videos.</li>
                <li>YouTube has at least one search bar on every page. Therefore, YouTube affords directing the user to a specific video.</li>
                <li>YouTube has buttons specifically for users to click whether they like or dislike the video. Therefore, YouTube affords giving ratings to a video.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The buttons themselves are not affordances. Affordance is 'what are possible'; 'what can the user do on this site'. The buttons are there to tell how to do 'what are possible' by, for example, clicking the button or swiping down or up.</p>
            <p>These buttons or helpers are instead called <a href="02-understanding-signifiers.html"><strong>signifiers</strong></a>. (Signifiers is covered in another article).</p><br>
